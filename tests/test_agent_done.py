"""An agent can take work and must be able to say it has finished.

`remember(claiming=true, paths=[...])` is how an agent claims files over MCP; `done` is how it gives them back. Without
`done`, every agent claim lapsed instead of closing: other agents waited out the whole hold on finished work, and
`record.holds_for` (which learns from the share of claims an agent closed) sat every agent at zero. These tests drive
the loop through the surface an agent actually has, the MCP tools, not through Python helpers.

Rewritten for 0.2.0: claims are path globs in claims.db, `done` releases only the caller's own claims, and a person
can release everyone's with `knos done --all` (after confirming, or with `--yes`). Nothing was dropped; the two
`knos done --all` tests are new, because that is now the only way to release another agent's claim.
