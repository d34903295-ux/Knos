"""House rule: Sibyl is the only durable store. Delete memory.db and the product must die.

Found in the full read (memory.py:142): opening a repo whose store had been deleted silently created an empty one, so
every question answered "nothing is known". Now a store that was born here and is gone is refused in words. `knos point`
is incremental and never deletes or recreates anything; starting over is `knos reset --yes`, which keeps a backup.

Dropped in 0.2.0: `test_knos_point_starts_over_on_purpose` (point no longer starts over; `knos reset --yes` does, and is
tested here instead).
