"""Take Sibyl away and knos stops being knos.

There is no second store, no cache, no fallback file. Everything a person or
an agent asks for is answered out of Sibyl, so these tests break the store on
purpose and show the product failing rather than degrading quietly.

Read this file first if you want to know whether the memory is real.

Rewritten for 0.2.0, where claims moved out of the Sibyl store into claims.db and are annotated, never withheld.
Dropped (behaviour removed):
  - the mcp search "Withheld." reply and `mcp._held` (answers are never withheld now; see
    test_search_tells_an_agent_someone_else_holds_the_file for what replaced it)
  - `Memory.working_on` / `current_work` / `stood_down` / `claim_if_free` / `claims` (the hot claim tier)
  - status patching `cli._store_mb`, which never existed (replaced by a test that makes Sibyl's own size
    measurement report 4.2 MB)
