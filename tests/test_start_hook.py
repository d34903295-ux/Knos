"""The notice an agent gets before it asks anything, and when it must stay quiet.

Every other way knos speaks depends on an agent choosing to call a tool. An agent that never calls `search` never
learns that somebody else is mid-change on the file it is about to open. `SessionStart` closes that: the host runs
`knos hook start` once when a session opens and puts what it prints into the session's own context. In 0.2.0 it also
records the host's session id against the host process in claims.db, which is how the MCP server that host starts
learns which session it serves.

Properties pinned here:

  - it is silent when there is nothing to say (a hook that speaks every time is a hook people learn to skip);
  - a live claim is named with who holds it and how long is left, and notes written down reach the session;
  - it records (host, session_id, anchor) from the hook's JSON payload, in the repo the payload's `cwd` names;
  - it never fails a session: every path returns 0, including a broken store and an unreadable payload;
  - the Claude Code plugin registers it, and `knos hook start` reaches it.

Rewritten for 0.2.0. Dropped with the 0.1 store: the `knos.core.Claims(repo=, who=)` and `Memory.working_on` ways of
taking a claim (claims are `knos.claims.Claims` with an `identity.Agent` now), and `answer.point` as the way to read a
repo in a test (`refresh.ensure` is what the product calls).
