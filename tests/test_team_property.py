"""The claim protocol's property test: exactly one winner, and the winner is never blocked.

Each round, five holders (five member keys, as on five machines) race for units drawn from an overlapping pool:
files, their directories, and a nested directory, under a fresh prefix. The units are only strings hashed with the
team salt, so they exist on no disk but the claimer's (none here at all). Decisions are read through a second RPC
endpoint that lags the node by 2-5 slots. Some rounds also send dust to a claim address first, and some have a
holder "crash" right after its create: the claim is on chain, undecided and never closed.

After every round:
  - no two winning claims overlap (zero double winners);
  - every winner is allowed to edit its unit by the guard's own rule (zero holder blocks), even while a later
    overlapping claim is pending or its claimer has crashed;
  - every other holder that overlaps a winner is refused.

Rounds: KNOSTEST_PROPERTY_N (default 10 in the normal suite; the ship runs 1,000 locally and 200 in CI).
