"""Every command, every error path, `knos init` on a fake home, and help that fits one screen.

The console script is `knos.cli:main(argv) -> int`: a failure is one line and the command that fixes it, never a
traceback; exit 1 for a failure a person can fix, 2 for a usage error. These tests call `main([...])` and read what
it printed, the way a person reads it.

Rewritten for 0.2.0. Dropped, because the thing they tested is gone from the product:

  - the `knos connect --print` paste text (`knos.mcp` module path, "knos connect" by hand) and the 0.1 writer's
    private helpers (`_config_files`, `_write_configs`, `_claude_cli`, `*.before-knos` copies, "already has it",
    "nothing to restart"); the same purposes are now tested through `knos init` (adds and keeps everything else,
    idempotent, leaves an unreadable config alone, skips agents that are not installed, `claude mcp add`, the
    OpenCode shape and its env var, every platform's config path, the exact restart line per app);
  - the Claude Desktop extension manifest check: extension/ is not part of 0.2.0 (it still pins knos==0.1.8 and
    advertises three tools); the plugin and marketplace manifests are still checked;
  - the README first-screen test: it asserted the GitHub Action and the CI pull-request warning, which 0.2.0 removed;
  - "CLAUDE.md cannot do that" on the main screen: the 0.2.0 screen states the pitch differently (checked below);
  - status's "things learned" / "MB of 5 MB used" wording from the 0.1 store (status is checked against 0.2.0's).

The jargon list no longer bans "mcp" (0.2.0's `knos init` page names the memory server "(MCP)" because that is what
every agent's settings call it) nor "wallet", "onchain" and "gas" (Knos Pro is bought from a Solana wallet).
