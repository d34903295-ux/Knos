"""What every agent is told at the start of a session, before it asks anything.

A `SessionStart` hook runs once when a session opens. It does two things:

  - it records the host's `session_id` against the host process (`claims.Claims.record_session`), which is how the
    MCP server that host starts learns which session it serves (`identity.py`);
  - it prints the live claims and the most recent notes, which the host puts into the session's own context. It prints
    nothing when there is nothing claimed and nothing written down.

It never fails a session: any error exits 0, writes one line to ~/.knos/hook.log and prints nothing. It imports only
the store, since it is on the path of opening every session.
