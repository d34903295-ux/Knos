"""Durable memory, one Sibyl store per repo, on this machine only.

Every answer knos gives comes out of Sibyl's memory engine (sibyl-memory-client). Sibyl's free tier caps the stores
an agent on this machine writes to at 5 MB together; knos does not patch or route around that cap. It keeps what can
be rebuilt out of the store (the code-structure index is a tags file beside it), warns at 80%, and names the two ways
on: `knos compact`, or Knos Pro, which includes Sibyl Pro (`knos pro buy`). A Sibyl account already on this machine
(~/.sibyl-memory/credentials.json) is passed to Sibyl's own cap gate, so paying Sibyl users are not capped.

    WARM entities    one canonical record per thing (schema-unique)

    HOT state        what the current work is about
    REFERENCE        facts that do not change
